## <h1 align="center" id="heading"> 👋 Welcome to the AI Engineering Challenge</h1>

## 🤖 Your First Vibe Coding LLM Application

> If you need an introduction to `git`, or information on how to set up API keys for the tools we'll be using in this repository - check out our [Interactive Dev Environment for LLM Development](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Interactive-Dev-Environment-for-AI-Engineers) which has everything you'd need to get started in this repository!

In this repository, we'll walk you through the steps to create a LLM (Large Language Model) powered application with a vibe-coded frontend!

Are you ready? Let's get started!

<details>
  <summary>🖥️ Accessing "gpt-4.1-mini" (ChatGPT) like a developer</summary>

1. Head to [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sT7rzY_Lb1_wS0ELI1JJfff0NUEcSD72?usp=sharing) and follow along with the instructions!

2. Complete the notebook and try out your own system/assistant messages!

That's it! Head to the next step and start building your application!

  <summary>🏗️ Cloning This Repository</summary>

1. Clone [this](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineering-Challenge) repo.

     ``` bash
     git clone git@github.com:AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineering-Challenge.git
     ```

2. Open the freshly cloned repository inside Cursor!

     ```bash
     cd The-AI-Engineering-Challenge
     cursor .
     ```

3. Check out the existing backend code found in `/api/app.py`

  <summary>😎 Vibe Coding a Front End</summary>

1. Use `Command-L` or `CTRL-L` to open the Cursor chat console. 

2. Set the chat settings to the following:

3. Modify the rules (found in `.cursor/rules`) to your liking. (Give theme suggestions, and more, in `frontend-rule.mdc`)

4. Ask Cursor to create a frontend for your application. Iterate as much as you like!

5. Run the frontend using the instructions Cursor provided. 

> NOTE: If you run into any errors, copy and paste them back into the Cursor chat window - and ask Cursor to fix them!

  <summary>🚀 Deploying Your First LLM-powered Application with Vercel</summary>

1. Ensure you have signed into [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with your GitHub account.

2. Ensure you have `npm` (this may have been installed in the previous vibe-coding step!) - if you need help with that, ask Cursor!

3. Run the command:

     ```bash
     npm install -g vercel
     ```

4. Run the command:

     ```bash
     vercel
     ```

5. Follow the in-terminal instructions. (Below is an example of what you will see!)
